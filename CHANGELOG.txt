# CF Compat Change Log

## 1.5
- added filter for the constant definition of `CF_NO_EXCERPT_LENGTH`, so we don't have to hack the plugin to change it.
- function `cf_trim_text`:
	- Added a $before and $after parameter to function. (mostly so we can add elipsis if necessary)

## 1.4

cf_non_admin_redirect received the following changes:
- receives an argument $capability that defaults to 'edit_pages'
- $below_threshold - true if the page is an admin page and the current user does not have $capability (filterable)
- main if statement checks the value $below_threshold, redirecting if true.
