# CF Compat Change Log

## 1.5.2.2 (trunk)
- Make the `cf_trim_text` multi-byte aware. 
- Added cf_get_blog_list since it was deprecated in WP core

## 1.5.2.1
- made the check for async-upload more robust as well as more loosely coupled to specific server types.

## 1.5.2
- Added a check to the cf_non_admin_redirect to make sure that the async-upload functionality (used by the flash uploader) is not redirected.

## 1.5.1
- made query logging easier to toggle
- function `cf_trim_text`:
	- Returning the $text if the incoming text is shorter than the $length param.

## 1.5
- added filter for the constant definition of `CF_NO_EXCERPT_LENGTH`, so we don't have to hack the plugin to change it.
- function `cf_trim_text`:
	- Added a $before and $after parameter to function. (mostly so we can add elipsis if necessary)
- function `cf_trim_content`:
	- stripping tags from content
	- Adding reg_ex: `preg_replace('/\[(.*?)\]/','',$content)`
- function `cf_tiny_mce`:
	- Adding tiny_mce functionality for text areas outside of post/page edit screens
- function `cf_trim_content_with_shortcodes`:
	- Content handler for shortening the amount of content

## 1.4
- function `cf_non_admin_redirect`:
	- receives an argument $capability that defaults to 'edit_pages'
	- $below_threshold - true if the page is an admin page and the current user does not have $capability (filterable)
	- main if statement checks the value $below_threshold, redirecting if true.
